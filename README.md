📚 Book Recommendation System
Overview
The Book Recommendation System is a machine learning-based project that suggests books to users based on their reading history, preferences, and ratings. It leverages collaborative filtering and content-based filtering algorithms to provide personalized recommendations.

Features
📖 Personalized Recommendations: Suggests books based on user preferences and ratings.
🔍 Search Functionality: Users can search for specific books and get recommendations based on the search.
⭐ Rating System: Users can rate books, which improves recommendation accuracy.
🧠 Machine Learning Models: Implements collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid models to recommend books.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Virtual Environment (recommended)
Dependencies
You can install the required dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
The key dependencies include:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
surprise (for collaborative filtering)
Flask (for web deployment, optional)
Dataset
You can use publicly available datasets like:

Goodreads dataset
Book-Crossing dataset
To use your own dataset, format it as a CSV file with columns for user IDs, book IDs, ratings, and titles.

Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Book-Recommendation-System.git
cd Book-Recommendation-System
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Model Training: Train the recommendation model on the dataset:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py --data dataset/books.csv
Get Book Recommendations: After training, use the recommendation engine to get book suggestions:

bash
Copy code
python recommend.py --user 123

How It Works
Collaborative Filtering: Recommends books based on similarities between users (user-based) or between books (item-based).
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends books based on the attributes of the book itself (genre, author, etc.).
Hybrid Approach: Combines collaborative filtering and content-based methods for better recommendations.
Example Output
csharp
Copy code
Recommended books for User 123:
1. "The Catcher in the Rye" by J.D. Salinger
2. "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee
3. "1984" by George Orwell
Future Improvements
Implementing real-time recommendations using APIs.
Adding user reviews to improve recommendation quality.
Exploring deep learning-based recommendation systems.
